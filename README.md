### Hey There 
<br />
hi, i'm [MD.Seam Uddin](https://about.me/md.seamuddin), A versatile technological expert with two years of software engineering experience. I've worked with PHP, Python, Django, Javascript, and React to create multi-dimensional applications.

I've spent the last year and a half developing, improving, and introducing modules for ERP systems. During this time, I also learned a lot about the business flow of HRM, inventory, financial management, customer relationship management, and other areas.

I'm always eager to learn new things. As a result, I am constantly looking for new topics to research, apply, and integrate.
